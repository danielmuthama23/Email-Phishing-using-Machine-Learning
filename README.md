"## Email-Phishing-using-Machine-Learning" 

### Overview
The Email Phishing Detection using Machine Learning project is designed to identify and classify phishing emails using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and phishing emails, helping users protect themselves from phishing attacks.

### Features
Phishing Email Detection: Classifies emails as either legitimate or phishing.
Machine Learning Models: Uses various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and data cleaning.
Model Evaluation: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.
Extensible: Easy to extend with more features or additional models.

### Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow (optional)
Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLTK, SpaCy
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Web Framework (optional): Flask/Django for deploying the model as a web servic
